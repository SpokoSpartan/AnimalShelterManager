## 1. App description
Pet Transfer System will be an application for private non-profit organizations, that rescue and organize adoptions of pets, specifically exotic ones. Known systems are designed for cats and dogs. We would like to expand this type of application to exotic animals. Also, we would like to design a user-friendly interface (system found by us seems to be difficult to use, because of the non-intuitive interface).

##### Functionality offered by the product:
* keep information about pets
* add information, add image, add labels to image profile (a type of animal)
* remove or archive profiles
* edit pet profile
* keep pet status (new in the shelter / ready for adoption / adopted / died)
* detailed information about pet
* special characters about the animal
* medical history / 
* vaccination history
* prices of visits and prices of treatments
* possibility of planing actions regarding the animals (e.g. haircut)
* transferring an animal between institutions
* possibility to view animals for adoption
* storing information about the person adopting the animal
##### Functionality that may be offered by product (may not be built):
* storing employee information
* probably the site with communication data
